# GSMBCD for large-scale optimization problems
This module provides a highly efficient algorithm for large-scale and high-dimensional optimization problems.

In particular,it provides an easy entry for users with Anaconda framework.No other specific packages is necessarily needed.If you don't have an Anconda environment,please install Numpy/Pandas/tqbm.

Use cmd commands,type in "python main.py" -hyperparameters and you will see results exhibited.

It contains two major features which brings you convience:easy for hyperparameters tuning and flexible for chart plotting.
As for solving,GSMBCD exceeds state-of-the-art methods in speed,space expenses,sparsity and memory occupancy rate.
